# Story will have Replacable words where we take input and complete the story and read it


'''One day, a <adjective> <animal> was wandering through the <place> when it stumbled upon a <adjective> <object>. Curious, it picked it up and suddenly, POOF!â€”the <object> started to glow!

Before the <animal> could react, a <adjective> <creature> appeared and said, "I am the guardian of the <object>! To keep it, you must complete a <adjective> challenge!"

The <animal> took a deep breath and bravely said, "I'm ready!"


What happened next? Well, that's a story for another day...
